QuickProto is a simple library for reading and writing Protocol Buffers
with no code generation. It is intended for use in testing, temporary 
scaffolding, and any situations where protocol buffer definitions are not
known at build time.

QuickProto requires a binary FileDescriptorSet representation of the protos
to be read. This can be generated by the protoc compiler using the -o option.
