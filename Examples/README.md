## Swift gRPC generated code examples

[Echo](Echo)
This sample demonstrates a simple echo service with nonstreaming and streaming APIS.
It can be run with or without TLS. Swift clients and servers are built in a Mac app 
and in a command-line tool that is built with the Swift Package Manager. An 
interoperable client and server is in the [Echo/Go] directory. 

This sample uses a client and server interface generated by the Swift gRPC plugin
for protoc.

## Low-level demonstrations

[Simple](Simple)
This sample demonstrates the low-level gRPC APIs with clients and servers
that can be built with Xcode or the Swift Package Manager.
