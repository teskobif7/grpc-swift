## Swift gRPC generated code examples

[Echo](Echo)
This sample demonstrates a simple echo service with nonstreaming and streaming APIS.
It can be run with or without TLS. Swift clients and servers are built in a Mac app 
and in a command-line tool that is built with the Swift Package Manager. An 
interoperable client and server is in the [Echo/Go] directory. 

This sample uses a client and server interface generated by the Swift gRPC plugin
for protoc.

## Low-level demonstrations

[Simple](Simple)
This is a simple command line tool, built with the Swift Package Manager, that 
implements a simple client and server using low-level gRPC APIs.

[Sessions](Sessions)
This is a Mac app that also implements a simple client and server using low-level
gRPC APIs.
